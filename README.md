Exercises

Go through the following tutorial on Unix shell:
https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

Record your shell session and submit it (see note below on how to record your session)

Install Git on your Ubuntu app
$  sudo apt get install git

Read through the excellent reference on GIT : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. Please make sure to go through chapters 1,2,3, 6 and also appendix A-1 on configuring your editor/IDE.

Pls. go through the hands-on exercises in the book and try it out using a private repo on GitHub. Record your session and submit it and share the GitHub repository.

Install Miniconda (not Conda enterprise or navigator) on your ubuntu App from the following link (use the linux 64 bit installer):
	https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Go through the Getting Started Guide and try out the commands in the guide. Record your session and submit it.


NOTE


Please record your Unix tutorial session, Git tutorial sessions and Conda session using the script shell command:
$ script -a ~/my_unix_session     # start recording your session

The above command starts a recording session and saves all the shell commands and outputs to a text file named my_unix_session in your home directory. The `-a` flag instructs the tool to append to the file if it already exists.
$ exit                            # exit recording your session

The above command will stop the recording session. Submit the text file containing the recorded session.
Deliverables
Recorded sessions for Unix tutorial, Git tutorial and the Conda tutorial.
A link to the GitHub repository used for the Git tutorial.
